# Recommandation System



This repository contains all the files for the recommendation system used in my "Lets Play" project. The system is developed to provide users with a variety of artists and genres, as I've noticed that other recommendation systems often suggest similar music and don't encourage users to explore a wide range of musical experiences.

The recommendation system is designed to consider a user's recent music history and preferences, if provided, in order to generate a list of 20 songs based on this input. The recommended songs are from related genres, feature a variety of artists, and may even include selections from completely unrelated genres.

The system is programmed to provide a different list each time, even with the same inputs. This deliberate design choice aims to enhance the user's listening experience by offering a unique selection each time.

This recommendation system is utilized in another project called "Lets Play," which is a Flask-based web app that integrates with Spotify to make use of its extensive music database.
